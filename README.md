- 👋 Hi, I’m @elenaharan, and I am a freshly certified full-stack web developer. I have just completed a 7 month immersive web development course with CareerFounry, 
and I am really excited to collaborate with others, build some amazing projects and learn about new tools along the way.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning a new programming language, deepening my understanding of the whole programming eco system and meeting some amazing programmers that I can learn from.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning front-end and back-end JavaScript and its frameworks.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any amazing projects with a good cause, even if it is outside of the scope of work I am familiar with, as I am willing to study intensively.
- 📫 How to reach me: Feel free to reach me through LinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/in/elenaharan/.
